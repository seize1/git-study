# Remember to
#    Capitalize the subject title in the “[]”.
#    Be careful write commit message,it is listing in the release note with final result.
#    Do not big-bang commit, Use only one commit for single feature.
#    Do not make log message more then necessary. it's make hard to other developers.
#    Do not use macro like as __DATE__ __TIME__ in code, it increse OTA update package.
#    First When commit code use "git pull" and add your code in the lastest update state. 
#    Do not interrupt the build process with an error commit.  
#    Use the description to explain what and why vs. how.
